# Form Validation 
This project is a simple registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to enter their username, email, password, and confirm their password. It includes basic validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly. The validation checks for empty fields, valid email format, password length, and matching passwords. If any validation fails, an appropriate error message is displayed next to the corresponding input field.
